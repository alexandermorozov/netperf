Netperf is a network bandwith test tool similar to iperf.

Features are:
- multiple TCP connections,
- auto reconnect if a connection breaks,
- it writes statistics to several files that can be easily visualized with
gnuplot.


Compile it with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC):
ghc -O2 -o netperf Main.hs

On the first host with ip_addr_1 run:
./netperf 4 6000 ip_addr_2 6000

On the second host with ip_addr_2 run:
./netperf 4 6000 ip_addr_1 6000
